The vulnerability in your Python installation is related to **parsing errors in the email module** (specifically in `_parseaddr.py`), which may lead to incorrect handling of email addresses with special characters. This issue is documented as **CVE-2023-27043** and affects Python versions 0â€“3.12.x.

### Why this issue occurs:
In certain versions of Python, the email module incorrectly parses email addresses with special characters. This bug allows attackers to bypass restrictions by crafting email addresses that the parser mishandles, potentially allowing unauthorized sending of emails.

### Remediation Steps:
1. **Update Python**: The primary recommendation is to update Python to a patched version. Versions 3.8.19, 3.9.19, 3.10.14, 3.11.9, and 3.12.5 have backported fixes. Upgrading to these versions or the latest version is advised to eliminate this vulnerability.
   - You can refer to the official Python changelog or documentation to download and install the updated version.

2. **Review Email Handling in Code**: If upgrading is not feasible, consider reviewing and testing the email parsing logic in your application, especially if it relies on handling user-provided email addresses.

3. **Monitor Security Announcements**: Keep an eye on Python security announcements for updates on patches, especially if your organization relies on stable but older versions of Python.

4. **Re-run Qualys Scan**: After applying the update, re-run the Qualys scan to verify the vulnerability has been remediated.

The changelog and related GitHub discussions on the fix are useful sources for verifying this issue and understanding the backported fixes. You can find these updates in the **Python 3.x Changelog** on Python's official website or GitHub Pull Requests and Issues related to CVE-2023-27043.
