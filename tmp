The vulnerability reported is a **heap-based buffer overflow** in 7-Zip, specifically affecting versions prior to 24.01. This issue arises from a bug in the 7-Zip software that can allow attackers to exploit the application, potentially leading to unauthorized code execution on your server. 

### Why this issue occurs:
A heap-based buffer overflow happens when a program writes more data to a block of memory, or heap, than was originally allocated. In the case of 7-Zip, an attacker could exploit this overflow to execute arbitrary code, potentially compromising the affected system. This is a serious vulnerability due to the high potential impact of remote code execution.

### Remediation Steps:
1. **Update 7-Zip**: The most effective way to remediate this vulnerability is to upgrade 7-Zip to the latest version (at least version 24.01 or higher), which has addressed this buffer overflow issue.
   - You can download the latest version from the official 7-Zip website and install it on your server.
   
2. **Remove Older Version**: If the update is not feasible, consider removing the 7-Zip application from the affected server to mitigate the risk.

3. **Monitor for Exploits**: Ensure that your server has a robust security monitoring system to detect any unusual activity, as vulnerabilities like this can sometimes be targeted quickly after discovery.

After updating or removing the affected software, rerun the vulnerability scan on Qualys to confirm that the issue is resolved.
